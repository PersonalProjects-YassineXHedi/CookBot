# 🤖 **CookBot – YOLOv12 Object Detection Model**

_A project focused on developing, optimizing, and deploying a YOLOv12 object detection model for real-time ingredient recognition on mobile devices._

---

## 📝 **Description**

This repository is dedicated to building the **core computer vision model** for the **CookBot app**, which detects food ingredients from photos in real time.

**Key objectives:**

- 🔬 **Dataset analysis & preparation** to maximize training quality,
- 🧠 **Model optimization** to improve detection accuracy and performance,
- 📱 **Mobile deployment**: transforming the model into a mobile-friendly version (TensorFlow Lite / ONNX),
- 🏷️ **Annotation & dataset management** using **Roboflow** to create high-quality training, validation, and testing sets.

The goal is to deliver a **lightweight, accurate, and fast object detection model** that can run seamlessly on Android devices within the CookBot ecosystem.

### 🔎 **Why This Matters**

The YOLOv12 model is a **core component** of CookBot's real-time ingredient detection system. For this to work smoothly on **mobile devices**, the model must be:

- **Highly accurate** despite working with a **relatively small, focused dataset** (~30 ingredients),
- **Efficiently optimized** to keep inference fast,
- **Portable** via conversion to formats like **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** and **ONNX.**

This repo focuses on every step of that pipeline—from dataset analysis to model deployment.
